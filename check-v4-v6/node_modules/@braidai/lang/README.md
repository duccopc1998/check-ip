# ðŸ”Œ @braidai/lang

This is a module with "standard library" type utilities. Anything that is provided out of the box in
a non-PHP, non-Java language might find a home in this module. It should have very few dependencies,
and certainly no dependencies to any other @braidai/* modules. Additionally, all code should run in
the browser as well as nodejs.
